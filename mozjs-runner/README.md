# MozJs runner

This is a project attempting to run spidermonkey similar to how node js runs v8. 

# What do we have?

There is a program which creates a run time and then runs a small script inline and returns a value.

# How to test?

```
$ cargo build

```

# Running

```
$ ./target/debug/mozjs-runner
```
